description="Adds a class called OverheadCar2D to Godot 4 that implements reasonbly good car physics. It's the car solution described here (http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/2d/car_steering/) and here (https://engineeringdotnet.blogspot.com/2010/04/simple-2d-car-physics-in-games.html) but adapted for Godot 4 and shared so it can be easily reused. It extends CharacterBody2D."
